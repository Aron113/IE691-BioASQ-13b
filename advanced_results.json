      "question": "Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?",
      "generated_answer": "Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is considered a multifactorial disorder rather than a Mendelian disorder. While some identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease, HSCR is characterized by complex inheritance patterns and interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in genes like RET contribute to the risk of HSCR in combination with mutations at other genes, highlighting the multifactorial nature of the disease."

Specifically, ivabradine reduces the heart rate by selectively inhibiting the If current. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and sinus rhythm, heart rate reduction with ivabradine has been associated with a reduction in the composite incidence of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization. Therefore, ivabradine may be a valuable addition to the management of heart failure after myocardial infarction."
